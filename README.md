# Comp475_Project

Project done in the context of a class on immersive technologies.

In an Unreal Engine VR project, we implemented various "hand input approximations" as described in the paper [Exploring Input Approximations for Control Panels in Virtual Reality](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9417652) by M. Tatzgern and C. Birgmann. It was presented with [the following slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dg7OmYlM185wWAp959KXPwcm_Ie30xg212OJzyOmSQw/edit?usp=sharing).
